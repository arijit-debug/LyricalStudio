## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# LyricalStudio — project rules (shared by Claude Code and Antigravity)

## What this is
Open-source (MIT) web music player whose main feature is Cotodama-style kinetic lyric typography, styled with Apple's design language (system colors, album-art gradients, glass materials, spring motion). Desktop-first.

## Decisions already made (don't revisit without the owner)
- Playback: official YouTube IFrame Player API. YouTube policy requires the player to stay visible and uncovered (min 200x200 px), so show it as a small video tile; never hide or overlay it. Never download, rip, proxy or host audio (no yt-dlp, no stream extraction).
- Search: the official YouTube Data API when YOUTUBE_API_KEY is set, otherwise youtubei.js on the server (prefer "Artist - Topic" album uploads for lyric timing). Metadata/artwork: iTunes Search API. Lyrics: LRCLIB, plus lrcmux for word timing (credit them).
- No accounts: the app is guest-only. Likes, recently played songs and per-song sync offsets live in the browser (localStorage). Don't add login or a database without the owner.
- Languages: English, Japanese, Hindi. Japanese needs word segmentation (Intl.Segmenter), Hindi uses Devanagari fonts.
- Style: bold Cotodama-like typography, Apple system colors + album-art palette. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Fonts: system stack (-apple-system) with Inter / Noto Sans JP / Noto Sans Devanagari fallbacks. Never bundle SF Pro.
- No secrets in the repo: keys live in .env.local; document every key in .env.example.

## Layout
- src/app/api — search, radio, home, playlist (YouTube), lyrics (LRCLIB + lrcmux), romanize (optional Gemini), meta (iTunes genre/artwork), image (artwork proxy for color extraction)
- src/lib/lyrics — LRC parsing, word timing estimates (per-song pace), useTrackData hook
- src/lib/clock — PlaybackClock smooths the IFrame player's coarse time reports
- src/lib/search — search backends: official YouTube Data API (YOUTUBE_API_KEY) or youtubei.js (YOUTUBEI_ENABLED)
- src/lib/youtube, src/lib/theme, src/lib/library
- src/components — AppShell (providers + layout), player, stage, search, MobileNotice
- src/proxy.ts — per-IP rate limits on /api/*
- src/app/privacy — privacy policy and terms
- src/templates — lyric animation templates, one per file; chooseTemplate() in index.ts picks per line

## Conventions
- Layout: Home uses the full width; the lyrics stage keeps clear of the 200x200 floating mini-player (YouTube requires it visible while playing). Up next / video / full-screen live in the header. Scrollbars are hidden globally; rows have arrow buttons.
- Exactly one YouTube player: PlayerProvider.attachHost records the host synchronously (dev Strict Mode attaches twice). After loadVideoById the IFrame API keeps reporting the old video's time (and ads may play): confirmSwitch gates the clock until the new song is really playing.
- Lyrics sources (src/lib/lyrics/sources.ts): LRCLIB is the main source. lrcmux (api.lrcmux.dev/get?format=lrc) is used only when it has word-by-word timing AND its line timing agrees with LRCLIB (timingAgrees), or LRCLIB has no synced lyrics. lrcmux line-only results are never used (they can be badly off, e.g. merged lines). No guessed-timing sources (YouTube Music lyrics, lyrics.ovh were removed); LRCLIB plain lyrics still get estimated timing. Japanese per-character word timings are regrouped into phrases in buildLines. Don't spoof headers or work around bot checks to reach other sources.
- Lyrics: LRCLIB outages return { unavailable: true } with status 503 (never cached); the client retries every 20 s and keeps the last 150 songs' lyrics in localStorage (src/lib/lyrics/cache.ts, versioned prefix: bump it when source rules change).
- Letter-by-letter animation must split with splitLetters() (src/templates/shared.ts), never [...text]: code points orphan Hindi vowel signs/viramas (dotted circles).
- Transliteration and combining marks: Devanagari Nuktas (`\u093C`) must be merged directly into consonant tokens (`ज़` → `z`, `ख़` → `kh`, etc.) and unconsumed combining marks dropped, otherwise browsers render dotted circle placeholders (`◌`). Urdu abjad vowel omission is handled via common lyrical lexicon and contextual vowel restoration. Lyric timestamps (`time`, `endTime`) must be preserved strictly when transliterating.
- Lyric stage uses CSS container units (cqw/cqh), not vw/vh, so lyrics never run under the YouTube tile.
- Load external artwork with referrerPolicy="no-referrer" (googleusercontent blocks some referrers).
- Background visuals live in one WebGL shader (src/components/stage/AmbientBackground.tsx); don't add DOM shapes, blend modes, backdrop-filters or filters behind/over the lyrics. Words get cheap text-shadows only.
- Type: white lyrics with vivid highlights (wordColor/vivid). Highlights are random (highlightSet): 1-4 real words per line, reshuffled every play via a per-play seed. Lyrics are live DOM text; no continuous scaling of text (it rasterizes and looks soft). No residue: previous lines must fully disappear when the next one starts (no echoes, no faint previews). One exception, by owner decision: in Graph, consecutive lines form one continuous drawing (src/templates/GraphStream.tsx) on a canvas covering the whole window (the current line is centered, fitted to the window height and kept clear of the video tile's column), and while it plays the header, control bar and cursor auto-hide after 3 s idle (immersive mode; the YouTube tile always stays visible and only glides down into the space the control bar leaves), and the last two ended lines stay on screen, dimmed and "blurred" (text-shadow on transparent text; branches as a stack of ever wider, fainter strokes so the falloff is gradual; never a CSS filter). Graph branches draw in on the compositor (a clip window sliding over the curve, dots as divs): don't animate stroke-dashoffset or SVG element transforms, they repaint on the main thread every frame. Graph font sizes snap to steps (stepFont) and are set up in idle time (FontWarmer): each never-seen font size costs ~1 ms of layout on Windows. Duets get two vines (src/lib/lyrics/voices.ts): lyrics sources never say who sings which line, so when the credits name several singers, verses alternate between a left and a right lane (sections split at long pauses), choruses (runs of 3+ repeated lines) use the full width and the vines merge there, and lines entirely in parentheses are small "echo" lines. It's a style that follows common duet structure, not detection; never present it as knowing the singer. Songs that are neither duets nor have echo lines must keep the original layout (assignVoices returns null).
- Stage drift: the whole lyric stage floats constantly and subtly (.ls-drift in globals.css: translate plus a fraction of a degree of rotation, never scale), outside the per-line cross-fade so it never restarts. It is off under prefers-reduced-motion.
- Smoothness: lyric motion runs on the compositor via the Web Animations API (src/templates/waapi.ts: animateTo, springTiming bakes springs into linear() easing). Animate only transform/opacity (or the individual rotate/scale properties). Don't drive lyric motion from JS frame loops (motion values), and never animate CSS blur. Motion blur = delayed trail copies in KineticWord.
- Don't clip words with overflow-hidden wrappers: it cuts the highlight glow into a visible box.
- No permanent will-change and no 3D transforms at rest on words (rotateX only while flipping): each forces a GPU layer per word.
- Per-line seeds must be unsigned: (a ^ b) >>> 0. A negative seed % 3 indexes past the palette.
- No color-mix() in CSS: the Tailwind/Lightning CSS build "lowers" it to opaque fallbacks. Compute colors in JS (see pastel/lyricShadow in src/templates/shared.ts).
- backdrop-filter must be set as an inline style; the CSS build drops the unprefixed property.
- Lyrics must never be cut off: every word element carries data-fit and sits inside a FitBox (src/templates/FitBox.tsx), which knows the camera's tilt/zoom. After changing any layout, run the fit check: `npm run dev`, open /dev/fit (dev-only page), and expect 0 failures.
- If CSS changes don't show up in `npm run dev`, restart the dev server; its stylesheet watcher can go stale.

## Workflow
- One tool per feature branch; open a PR into main.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing.
