## What it does

- **Search and play almost any song.** Playback goes through YouTube's official embedded player, shown as a small video tile. Results include album tracks and video uploads (live versions, covers, mashups), with the best title matches first, even when the spelling differs a little.
- **Loop and play next.** Repeat a song with one click (or `L`), and add any search result to play right after the current song.
- **Lyrics that move with the music:** synced line by line, and word by word where the lyrics source has word timings.
- **Lyrics in Latin letters.** The **En** button (or `T`) shows Hindi as Hinglish, and Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu in Roman script, keeping the same timing. It runs in your browser; a site owner can optionally add a Gemini key for better romanization of Urdu, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.
- **Seven text layouts:** Stack, Slide, Zoom, Letters, Scatter, Graph and Flow. "Auto style" picks one for each line from the song's genre, pace and chorus, or you can choose one yourself.
- **Graph draws one continuous vine:** each new line grows out of the last one, the camera follows it, and the previous two lines linger above, dimmed and softly blurred. **Duets get two vines:** when a song credits more than one singer, verses alternate between a left and a right vine, and they merge for the chorus. Backing vocals in parentheses are drawn as small lines. While Graph plays, the controls and cursor fade away after 3 seconds without input (move the mouse to bring them back); the video tile stays visible and moves down into the corner.
- **Always gently in motion:** the lyrics float a little all the time, even between words and during instrumental parts.
- **YouTube captions for songs without lyrics:** when no lyrics are found, a button turns on the video's own captions (when YouTube has them), and the video grows so they're readable.
- **Colors from the album art:** white lyrics with vivid highlights on a few words per line, picked at random every time the song plays.
- **A flowing "liquid glass" background** drawn on the GPU (WebGL), with ripples from each word as it's sung.
- **Smooth, crisp motion:** springy word entrances and motion blur. Text stays sharp once it settles, and lines always fit on screen. Animations run on the GPU, and on slower computers a lighter mode switches on by itself so motion stays smooth.
- **English, Japanese (日本語) and Hindi (हिन्दी),** with romanized lines shown as subtitles when the source has them.
- **Up next:** related songs line up automatically and keep playing when your queue ends.
- **Home screen:** recently played songs, liked songs and "Made for you" suggestions.
- **Sync nudge:** if lyrics run early or late, shift them with `[` and `]`. The fix is saved for that song.
- **No account needed.** Likes, history and settings are saved in your browser.
- **Respects "reduce motion"** in your operating system's accessibility settings.

## Using LyricalStudio

1. Open **[lyricalstudio.vercel.app](https://lyricalstudio.vercel.app)** in a desktop browser.
2. Press **Ctrl K** (or **/**) and type a song or artist.
3. Click a result. The song starts and the lyrics stage opens.
4. Use the bar at the bottom to play or pause, skip, seek, loop, like a song (♥), nudge the sync, pick a lyric style, or switch the lyrics to Latin letters (**En**).
5. The buttons at the top right open **Up next**, enlarge the **video**, or go **full screen**.

LyricalStudio is designed for desktop and laptop browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). On phones it shows a "best on a bigger screen" notice, which you can dismiss.

## Install and run it on your computer

> **Just want to use the app?** You don't need any of this. Open **[lyricalstudio.vercel.app](https://lyricalstudio.vercel.app)**.
>
> This section is for running your own copy, for example to change the code or contribute.

You don't need any accounts or keys to run LyricalStudio locally.

### 1. Install the tools

| Tool | Version | Get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 20 or newer (22 LTS recommended) | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (the installer includes npm) |
| Git | any recent version | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

Check that they're installed by opening a terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux) and running:

```bash
node -v   # should print v20 or higher
git --version
```

### 2. Download the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arijit-debug/LyricalStudio.git
cd LyricalStudio
```

Prefer not to use Git? Click **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub, unzip it, and open a terminal in the unzipped folder.

### 3. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This takes a minute or two the first time.

### 4. Start it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. That's it: search for a song and press play.

To stop the server, press **Ctrl C** in the terminal.

### Optional: run the faster production version

`npm run dev` is for development: it reloads when you edit code, but it's slower. To run the optimized version:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Settings (environment variables)

**Everything is optional.** To change a setting, copy the example file and edit the copy:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp .env.example .env.local
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
```

Restart `npm run dev` after editing `.env.local`. Git ignores this file, so your keys never get committed.

| Variable | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | Uses the official [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) for search. See [the next section](#getting-a-youtube-data-api-key). | Not set: search uses youtubei.js |
| `YOUTUBEI_ENABLED` | Set to `false` to never use youtubei.js, the unofficial YouTube Music client. Turns off the YouTube Music home feed and playlists. Recommended for public sites, together with `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`. | On |
| `YOUTUBE_SEARCHES_PER_IP_PER_DAY` | How many official-API searches one visitor can trigger per day. Cached searches don't count. Stops one person from using up the whole site's quota. | `25` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | A [Google Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) key for AI romanization of Urdu, Japanese, Chinese and Korean lyrics. Only lyrics text is sent, at most 30 songs per visitor per day. When Gemini is busy or the key isn't set, the built-in romanizer is used. | Not set: built-in romanizer only |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Shares the per-visitor rate limits across all server instances, using a free [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database. | Each instance counts on its own |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Set to `off` to disable rate limiting. | On |

**Which search should I use?**

- **On your own computer:** leave everything unset. youtubei.js has no daily limit and gives the richest home screen.
- **On a public website:** set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` and `YOUTUBEI_ENABLED=false`. youtubei.js is unofficial and isn't allowed by YouTube's Terms of Service, and YouTube often blocks it on cloud servers. The official API has a free daily quota instead (see [Limits](#limits-and-known-issues)).

## Getting a YouTube Data API key

The key is free. Google doesn't charge for YouTube Data API usage: when the daily quota runs out, search simply pauses until the next day.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in.
2. Create a project: click the project picker at the top → **New project** → name it (e.g. `lyricalstudio`) → **Create**.
3. Open **APIs & Services → Library**, search for **YouTube Data API v3**, and click **Enable**.
4. Open **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key**.
5. Click the new key and, under **API restrictions**, choose **Restrict key** → **YouTube Data API v3** → **Save**. Restricting it means a leaked key can't be used for any other Google API.
6. Put it in `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

> **Keep the key secret.** Never commit it, paste it into an issue, or put it in a variable starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (those are sent to the browser). You don't need a billing account for this API, so don't add one to the project.

## Putting it online (Vercel)

LyricalStudio is a standard [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app. [Vercel](https://vercel.com)'s free Hobby plan is the simplest way to host it (non-commercial use only).

1. Push your copy of the code to GitHub (or fork this repository).
2. Sign in to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) with GitHub → **Add New → Project** → import the repository.
3. Under **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` = your key
   - `YOUTUBEI_ENABLED` = `false`
   - Optional: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
4. Click **Deploy**. Every push to `main` deploys automatically after that.
5. If you host your own copy, update the links and contact details on the privacy page ([`src/app/privacy/page.tsx`](src/app/privacy/page.tsx)).

Other Node.js hosts work too: run `npm run build`, then `npm start` (it listens on port 3000; set `PORT` to change that). Put it behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx or Caddy) that sets `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` itself; otherwise visitors can fake those headers to get around the rate limits.

## How it works

```
Browser                                    Server (Next.js API routes)
───────                                    ───────────────────────────
Search box ──────────────────────────────▶ /api/search  → YouTube Data API or youtubei.js

```

| Part | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Playback | The official [YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference). The video tile always stays visible, as YouTube requires. |
| Search | [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) when a key is set, otherwise [youtubei.js](https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js) |
| Synced lyrics | [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net), the main source (line-by-line timing) |
| Word-by-word timing | [lrcmux](https://lrcmux.dev), used only when its timing matches LRCLIB's |
| Artwork and genre | [iTunes Search API](https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api) |
| Romanization | Built into the app (`src/lib/lyrics/transliterate.ts`); optionally [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) for Urdu, Japanese, Chinese and Korean |

LyricalStudio never downloads, stores or redistributes audio.

### Project layout

| Folder | What's there |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app/api/` | Server routes: search, lyrics, meta, image, radio, home, playlist, romanize |
| `src/app/privacy/` | Privacy policy and terms page |
| `src/proxy.ts` | Per-visitor rate limits on `/api/*` |
| `src/components/` | The app shell, player, lyrics stage, search panel and home screen |
| `src/templates/` | The lyric animation layouts, one per file. `chooseTemplate()` in `index.ts` picks one per line. |
| `src/lib/lyrics/` | LRC parsing, word-timing estimates, the lyrics cache, romanization |
| `src/lib/search/` | Search backends (official API and youtubei.js) |
| `src/lib/clock/` | Smooths the YouTube player's coarse time reports, so lyrics stay in sync |

## Limits and known issues

- **Search quota (official API only):** the free 10,000 units a day buys about 100 new searches a day for the whole site. Repeated searches come from a cache. After the quota runs out, search shows a message until the next day (midnight Pacific time). To share it fairly, each visitor can trigger up to 25 of those searches a day (`YOUTUBE_SEARCHES_PER_IP_PER_DAY`).
- **Some songs won't play** because the label blocks embedding. LyricalStudio tries another upload of the same song, then skips it.
- **YouTube may show ads** before songs, as in any embedded YouTube player.
- **Captions depend on YouTube.** Many videos have none, and auto-generated ones can be wrong.
- **Duet vines are a guess.** Lyrics services don't say who sings which line, so Graph alternates verses between the two vines, which matches most duets but not every song.
- **Romanization is approximate.** It follows spelling rules, so some words come out differently from how people usually write them (for example "gaddee" for "gaddi").
- **Lyrics aren't guaranteed.** They come from free community services, so some songs have none, only approximate timing, or mistakes. When a service is down, recently played songs still have lyrics from the browser cache.
- **The tab must stay open** for music to play. There's no background or offline playback.
- **Desktop-first.** Phones work, but the layout is made for larger screens.
- **Likes and history stay in one browser.** They don't sync between devices, and clearing site data removes them.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `node: command not found` or an old version | Install Node.js 20 or newer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then open a new terminal. |
| `npm install` fails | Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again. On Windows, keep the project in a normal folder (e.g. `Documents`), not inside `C:\Program Files`. |
| Port 3000 is already in use | Run `npm run dev -- -p 3001` and open http://localhost:3001. |
| "Search is unavailable" | youtubei.js may be temporarily blocked by YouTube. Wait a bit, or set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`. |
| "Today's search limit has been reached" | The official API quota is used up. It resets at midnight Pacific time. |
| "Search isn't configured on this server" | `YOUTUBEI_ENABLED=false` is set but `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` isn't. Add a key. |
| No lyrics for a song | The lyrics services don't have it yet. LyricalStudio checks again every minute while the song plays. |
| Lyrics are early or late | Press `[` or `]` (0.25 s steps). The fix is saved for that song. |
| A style or CSS change doesn't show up in `npm run dev` | Stop the dev server and start it again. |
| "Too many requests" | You hit the per-minute rate limit. Wait a minute. |

## Privacy

There are no accounts. Likes, history, cached lyrics and settings stay in your browser. The hosted site counts visits with Vercel Web Analytics, which is cookieless and anonymous. The server sends only song details (title, artist, album, length) to the lyrics and artwork services, never anything about you. If the site owner sets a Gemini API key, the lyrics text of songs in non-Latin scripts is also sent to Google Gemini for romanization. The YouTube player is run by Google under the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Read the full [privacy policy and terms](https://lyricalstudio.vercel.app/privacy).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, good first contributions and the ground rules. A new lyric layout in `src/templates/` is a great first project.

After changing a layout, run the fit check: with `npm run dev` running, open http://localhost:3000/dev/fit. It renders every line of ten songs in every layout and reports any word that would be cut off. Expect 0 failures.
